>[!NOTE] Looks like today was a big release day for TNOS!.
>
> TNOS was a program based on another program called NOS. This was written by [Phil Karn, KA9Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Karn). He was a US radio Ham who worked for Bell Labs & Qualcomm I beleive. 
>Essentially NOS (and TNOS) allowed you to create an IP network with your computer and a special modem  (called a TNC), which interfaced your VHF/UHF radio to your computer. Large networks were created by hobbyists around the world, which we used to pass TCP traffic over these networks. This was a class A, network 44.0.0.0/8 refered to as the [AMPRnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPRNet) [^1].

Below you can see my stack of TNC's to the right of the photo (from around 1996) with the radios they are connected to, to the middle and left.

[^1]: The AMPRnet was a large TCP/IP network which predates the public 'Internet' . In 2019 half of the class A network allocation was sold off to Amazon AWS due to a shortage of IPv4 addressing.
