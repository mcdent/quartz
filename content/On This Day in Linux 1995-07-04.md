>[!NOTE] Looks like today was a big release day for TNOS!.
> TNOS was a program based on another program called NOS. This was written by Phil Karn, KA9Q. He was a US radio Ham who worked for Qualcomm I beleive. 
>Essentially NOS (and TNOS) allowed you to create an IP network with your computer and a special modem  (called a TNC), which interfaced your VHF/UHF radio to your computer. Large networks were created by hobbyists and we used to pass TCP traffic over these links.

Below you can see my stack of TNC's to the right of the photo (from around 1999) with the radios they are connected to, to the middle and left.
