This is the first entry from my notebook. I started using Linux in late 1991, not long after Linus Torvalds announced it. I  must have realised, after a while, that keeping a Changelog was important. Being able to see what changes you made and if they broke  some other software, at least you had a chance of figuring out what had caused the issue. You could say this was an early form of `change management.`
So below is first the entry written in my A4, hard back, ruled notebook.

> [!NOTE] Installed Slackware 2.3.0
> Slackware was a popular distribution back in the day, in fact there was probably only around 4 or 5 distributions to choose from. I recall SLS [Softlanding Linux System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System) was the first distro I installed.  Rather peversely I still have the Slackware 3.5" floppy disks in my archive.
