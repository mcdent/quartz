> [!NOTE] Removed ncurses 1.8.6
> 
> Here we can see I was having trouble getting [[On This Day in Linux 1995-07-04|TNOS]] 1.14 to compile, so I ended up removing the version of ncurses I had with 'pkgtool' . I then installed an earlier version of ncurses from the Slackware 2 CD and I managed to compile TNOS.
