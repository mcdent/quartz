This is the first entry from my notebook. I started using Linux in late 1991, not long after Linus Torvalds announced it. I  must have realised that keeping a Changelog was important. Being able to see what changes you made and if it broke  some other software, at least you had a chance of figuring out what had caused the issue.

> [!NOTE] Removed ncurses 1.8.6
> Here we can see I was having trouble getting TNOS 1.14 to compile, so I ended up removing the version of ncurses I had with 'pkgtool' . I then installed an earlier version of ncurses from the Slackware 2 CD and I managed to compile TNOS.
